This is a weather app built with React that allows users to search for weather information of different locations. Users can input the name of a city, and the app will display a list of matching locations. The user can then select a location from the list to view detailed weather information for that location, including current weather conditions and a forecast for the next few days.

### While developing this weather app, I gained valuable experience and practiced various skills. Here are some of the things I learned and practiced during the development process:

* **TypeScript** integration to provide strong typing and improve code reliability.

* **React Components**: I practiced creating and managing different React components to build a modular and maintainable app structure. Components such as WeatherCard, InputForm, SearchOptions, and MoreDetails were created to encapsulate specific functionalities.

* **State Management**: I worked with `useState` hook to manage the state of the app.

* **API Integration**: I practiced fetching data from external APIs using JavaScript's `fetch` method. The app integrates with the Open-Meteo API to obtain weather data based on user inputs and location selections. 

* **Conditional Rendering**: I used conditional rendering techniques to show or hide specific components based on different states and user actions. For example, the SearchOptions component is displayed when there are search results, and the MoreDetails component is shown when the user wants to view additional weather details.

* **SCSS Styling**: I used `SCSS` (Sass) to style the app's components. `SCSS` allowed me to write more organized and reusable CSS code using features like variables and nesting.

* **Asynchronous JavaScript**: I practiced handling asynchronous operations, such as API requests, using `async/await` syntax. This allowed me to make the app more responsive and handle potential errors gracefully.

* **Mapping and Iterating**: I practiced mapping and iterating over arrays to dynamically render UI elements.

* **Error Handling**: I implemented error handling to display meaningful error messages when API requests fail or encounter other errors during data retrieval.

* **SVG Icons**: I used `SVG` icons to represent different weather conditions. I learned how to use SVGs as React components to display scalable and high-quality icons in the app.

* **GitHub Repository Management**: I practiced version control using `Git` and managed the project's source code in a GitHub repository. I made use of branches and commits to organize changes and collaborate on the project.

By working on this weather app, I gained practical experience in front-end development, improved my React skills, and learned how to integrate external APIs to provide valuable weather information to users. It was a great learning experience, and I look forward to further improving and expanding the app's features in the future.

Happy weather forecasting! ☀️
